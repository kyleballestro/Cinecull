TMDB API Stuff
-----------------------------------------------
- Runtime and seasons?
- Add a region section to broaden streaming service results

General Additions
-----------------------------------------------
- Add a "See More" button after filtering to recall the API with that title and media type to see 20 options
    - Only do it if the size of the mainList < 20
- Maybe a "See More Details" under the three dots of an item to see runtime, where it's streaming, maybe something else. This would be done with another API call 
  to its ID specifically.
- Maybe add a Page 1 > option to go to another page of results. It would be another API call


Misc.
-----------------------------------------------
- Choose a URL
    - flickpick.org is available
    - pickaflick.org
- Go through and update HTML with better tags


Firebase Authentication
----------------------------------------------

Database for Watchlist Table and Watched Table
-----------------------------------------------
- Add database that includes:
    - watchlist table of userID and movie details on that user's watchlist (include media ID)
    - watched table of userID and movie details on that user's watched (include media ID)
    ? - userID table
- Refresh cached data:
    1. Timestamp Your Cached Data
    When you cache data from TMDB, also store the timestamp of when the data was fetched. This allows you to determine how old the cached data is.
    2. Check Age Before Using Cached Data
    Before using any piece of cached data, compare its timestamp to the current time. If the data is older than 6 months, it should be refreshed.
    3. Refresh Outdated Cached Data
    If the cached data is older than 6 months, make a new request to the TMDB API to fetch the latest information. Replace the outdated cached data with this new data, including updating the timestamp to the current time.
