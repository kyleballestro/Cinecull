- Implement search with the API calls to TMDB
    - Once the relevant data is retrieved as JSON, parse it and make it into an array with the structure of watchlist
- Add Firebase authentication for user login
- Add database that includes:
    - userID table
    - watchlist table of userID and movie on that user's watchlist
    - watched table of userID and movie on that user's watched
    - maybe a table that stores media that has been added to a list for quicker application to main-list
        - otherwise when you make the watchlist/watched list you have to call the API for every media in that list to get the details
- Make the watchlist and watched list pull from the database
- Implement the filter sidebar functionality
