- Refresh cached data:
    1. Timestamp Your Cached Data
    When you cache data from TMDB, also store the timestamp of when the data was fetched. This allows you to determine how old the cached data is.
    2. Check Age Before Using Cached Data
    Before using any piece of cached data, compare its timestamp to the current time. If the data is older than 6 months, it should be refreshed.
    3. Refresh Outdated Cached Data
    If the cached data is older than 6 months, make a new request to the TMDB API to fetch the latest information. Replace the outdated cached data with this new data, including updating the timestamp to the current time.
