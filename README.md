# Cinecull
## A web application for users to keep a watchlist and watched list of movies/TV shows. Pulls media data from TMDB API and stores the lists in a MySQL database (functionality handled in Node.js server). Uses Firebase Authentication for user login and sign up.
Users can switch between their lists, sign up to persistently save their lists, filter the shown list with the sidebar, and search for a title to get movies/TV shows to add to their lists.
